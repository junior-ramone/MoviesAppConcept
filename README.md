# MoviesAppConcept
A Xamarin.Forms implementation for a movies app UI concept from Dribble

This UI is based on a design found on dribble by Ghani Pradita that you can check out [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/2784573-Rottentomatoes-App-Concept)

> I got data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), so I changed the colors a bit to match that

I was inspired by [@kphillpotts](https://github.com/kphillpotts/RottenUI) and I decided to make my own implementation to practice what I am learning in Xamarin.

In fact, this is my first project with XF.

### What I used
- Icon Fonts (Material Design)
- Shapes and gradients
- MVVM Helpers
